# Mathias Oliver Valdbjørn Rønnelund

👨‍💻 **Lead Software Developer | ML Architect**

I specialize in crafting ML architectures. Currently, leading a agile team at ATP Fraud Detection & AI Solutions, automating fraud detection in Danish public sectors and optimizing processes with AI. 

I have always had a huge passion for coding. Back when I was 11 I was shown how to code a "Hello World" HTML page and was blown away. Now many years later I am happy that my daily life consist primarily of coding.

⚒️ Previously I have worked as a part-time researcher at IT-University, focusing on privacy protection mechanisms and as a Freelance Consultant, I've tackled projects like integrating news for airline passengers.

🏫 I have a M.Sc. in Computer Science and a B.Sc. in Software Development
